            <strong>Lecture-based teaching:</strong>
            <br>
            In this traditional teaching method, the teacher presents information 
            to the students through a lecture. This can be effective for introducing new concepts or providing a broad overview of a topic.
            However, it may not be the most engaging method for all students and can sometimes result in passive learning.

            <strong>Inquiry-based teaching:</strong>
            <br> 
            This method involves asking questions and allowing students to explore
            and find the answers themselves. It encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills and can be effective
            for fostering curiosity and interest in a subject. 
            However, it requires a teacher who is comfortable with giving up control and allowing students to take the lead.

            <strong>Project-based teaching:</strong>
            <br> 
            This method involves students working on a project or assignment 
            that involves research, problem-solving, and creativity. It can be effective for promoting 
            collaboration and independent thinking and can be more engaging than traditional methods.
            However, it can also be more time-consuming and may require more preparation and planning on the teacher's part.

            <strong>Collaborative teaching: </strong>
            <br>
            This method involves students working together in groups or pairs to complete a task or assignment. 
            It can be effective for promoting teamwork and social skills and can provide opportunities for 
            students to learn from one another. However, it can also be challenging to ensure that all students 
            are contributing equally and may require careful management by the teacher.

            <strong>Flipped classroom teaching:</strong>
            <br> 
            This method involves students learning the material at home through online 
            videos or readings and then applying the knowledge in class through discussion and 
            group activities. It can be effective for promoting independent learning and can 
            be more engaging than traditional methods. However, it requires students to have access 
            to technology at home and may not be feasible for all schools or students.

            <strong>Game-based teaching:</strong>
            <br>
            This method involves using games or simulations to engage students in learning and reinforce concepts.
            It can be effective for promoting active learning and can be more engaging than traditional methods. <br> 
            However, it may require more preparation and planning on the teacher's part to find or create appropriate games.
